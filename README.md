# What is this ?
This is the a modification of the [TCP Gecko Installer](https://github.com/BullyWiiPlaza/tcpgecko). More simply, it is the source code of [MamiesMod Wii U.elf](http://nt-games-site.000webhostapp.com/other-1/mamiesmod-wii-u-app.html), a Wii U app for connect your Wii U to your PC.

# What is the MamiesMod Client ?
This is a cheat client for Minecraft Wii U. It's still only a **beta**, and doesn't yet feature a menu. Development began in the summer of 2022, following the release of the **HelloWorldClient** and **ShineClient** by [Clover](https://github.com/u08614s), and quickly came to a halt due to lack of time. I posted a [short video](https://youtu.be/VoVjL6O96Ws?si=GK3XQpc5Hvqj3CJg) to announce the start of the update, but as the project never saw the light of day, I preferred to keep it a secret.

# How do I use this ?
This is an app for the [Homebrew Launcher](https://github.com/dimok789/homebrew_launcher). For more information of [MamiesMod Wii U.elf](http://nt-games-site.000webhostapp.com/other-1/mamiesmod-wii-u-app.html) go [here](http://nt-games-site.000webhostapp.com/other-1/mamiesmod-wii-u-app.html). For know how to install and use [MamiesMod V4](https://youtu.be/BZxRxmEmlrw) go [here](https://www.youtube.com/c/ntgamesytb/).

# How do I compile ? 
Just like described [here](https://github.com/dimok789/homebrew_launcher/blob/master/README.md#building-the-homebrew-launcher). Furthermore, you need to `make install` [`iosuhax`](https://github.com/dimok789/libiosuhax) since it is a dependency as well.

# Any ideas for future updates ?
I never got around to making them, but here are the ideas I had planned for future updates :    
- Finish MamiesMod Client    
- Add the ability to change NNID in settings    
- Add music and sounds during the Elf execution    
- Add mocha background when launching MamiesMod Wii U    
- Add a fade effect with the text, when entering and exiting MamiesMod Wii U
